        - Worked on 3D indoor scene generation, specifically background texture generation for scenes through multi-view Control Net inpainting and back-projecting generated 2D images onto a texture map. During texture propagation, albedo optimization was attempted to ensure no lighting artifacts were stored in the map. We utilized the 3D-FRONT dataset, and used Blender for realistic renderings.
